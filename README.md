# EasyApi
Introducing Easy Api – a new way to define and consume Web APIs for Blazor apps. 

## Why would you want to use it?

### 1. Contract-First API development
  Bring order to your development process and gain a clear and consistent API structure.

### 2. Shared data model
  Harness the true power of Blazor with a single data model for your server and client code.  
  Forget about countless DTOs, mapping, versioning, and runtime errors.  
  Welcome EasyApi's type-safe contract shared between both ends of your application.

### 3. Unified logic across all Render Modes
  Stop worrying about where your client code is running.  
  Just call your requests and let EasyApi do the rest.  
  It does not matter if it is Wasm, SSR or prerendering – the job gets done.

### 4. No boilerplate
  Save time and focus on what's important.  
  EasyApi handles both client and server configuration for you.  
  All you need to do is define the contract and handle your requests.

## Sounds good?
